    -   6 bytes
    -   8 bytes
-   Variable data size
    -   0 bytes
    -   50 bytes

    -   1000 bytes

## Details

The above parameters created 135 tests which were run 3 times each and had their averages calculated.

Each test inserted 100,000 records into the database, including a spline index on the keys and a 8 byte bitmap index on the values. Key size was artificially increased when necessary by padding with 0's. Variable data was not inserted with every record, but instead had a chance (1 in $\frac{vardataSize}{10}$) of being inserted with a record such that there would be ~1 MB of variable data total.

Each test queried 10,000 records. This means that any read times recorded under a head like "Stats for 30000:" are actually only after 3000 queries. The queries were random reads generated by generating a random key in the range of keys inserted
